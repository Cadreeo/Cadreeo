### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Cadreeo, a student learning to use R for data visualizations. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data visualizations for my class.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to present data in an appropriate and easy manner.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can actually consistently solve a Rubiks Cube in under a minute, my record in 37 seconds.
